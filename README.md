Lima-City-PHP-API
=================

The PHP-API-Script for Lima-City.de

The official server these scripts are running on can be found at http://limaapi.dauerstoned-clan.de
Any other server that claims to be running these scripts are not of my knowledge and might be phishing your registration data.
For those unfortunate users who happened to have used any other server the only thing I can recommend is to change the current password.

I for my part say that I will never in any ways try to collect anyones data and I will not change anything in these scripts so that they do anything alike phishing.
The only part that will never be published to any public place will be the Server-Status-API-Key which will be saved and loaded from an independent config file in a way that is secure and does not allow anything else to be added to the sourcecode.

For those interested in what happens in the background when one of the developers pushes a change can have a look at http://jenkins.dauerstoned-clan.de/job/Lima-City-PHP-API/.
